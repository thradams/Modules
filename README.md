# Modules
Description for c compiler implementation.

Besides c compiler implementation, externals tools could be created to generate make files, visual studio solution, xcode solutions etc.. or existing tools could use the same representation as well as part of their configuration.

## What is a module?

From the C standard;

```
5.1.1.1 Program structure
1 A C program need not all be translated at the same time. The text of the program is kept
in units called source files, (or preprocessing files) in this International Standard. A
source file together with all the headers and source files included via the preprocessing
directive #include is known as a preprocessing translation unit. After preprocessing, a
preprocessing translation unit is called a translation unit. Previously translated translation
units may be preserved individually or in libraries. The separate translation units of a
program communicate by (for example) calls to functions whose identifiers have external
linkage, manipulation of objects whose identifiers have external linkage, or manipulation
of data files. Translation units may be separately translated and then later linked to
produce an executable program.
```
A module is a **preprocessing translation unit** itself or a **preprocessing translation unit group** .

## How to group preprocessing translation unit?

The sugestion is to use **#pragma source**.

Let's say I want to create a module for console functions. 
Other projects can use this module.

My module has these files:

```
Console
  Src
     ConsoleWin.c
     ConsoleLinux.c
     UnitTest.c
  Include
     Console.h     
```

We want to especify that compiling for windows we need Console.h and ConsoleWin.c, for linux we need Console.h and ConsoleLinux.c  and UnitTest is not necessary.

At Console.h we add **#pragma source**

```c

/*
   Console.h
*/

#ifdef WIN32
#pragma source "..\Scr\ConsoleWin.c"
#elif LINUX
#pragma source "..\Scr\ConsoleLinux.c"
#endif

...

```

Now to use this:

MyProgram.c

```c
#include "Console.h"

int main()
{
}
```

To compile:

```
ccompiler -DLINUX MyProgram.c
```

Myprogram.c is a module group.


## Non intrusive

Let's say the module for console was created before the module concept.

```
Console
  Src
     ConsoleWin.c
     ConsoleLinux.c
     UnitTest.c
  Include
     Console.h     
```
Now we can create a new file separately:

ConsoleModule.h

```c
#include "Console.h"

#ifdef WIN32
#pragma source ".\Console\Scr\ConsoleWin.c"
#elif LINUX
#pragma source ".\Console\Scr\ConsoleLinux.c"
#endif
```

I can now use this module in MyProgram:

```c
#include "ConsoleModule.h"  
int main()
{
}
```

```
ccompiler --DWIN32 MyProgram.c
```

Imagine module descriptions for all existing libraries: openssl, libtiff, zlib, libjpeg..
Then if you want to use some of these libraries in your project you can just copy a folder and include some file.

We also can make the entire MyProgram a module in a way that the original source files donÂ´t need the pragma source.

MyProgram.c
```c
#include "Console.h"  
int main()
{
}
```

MyProgramModule.c
```
#include "ConsoleModule.h"
#pragma source "MyProgram.c"
```

```
ccompiler --DWIN32 MyProgramModule.c
```



## Other pragmas

The idea is give information about libraries and include dir.

```
#pragma includedir ""

#pragma library ""
//see #pragma comment(lib, "lib.lib") from Microsoft compiler

```
